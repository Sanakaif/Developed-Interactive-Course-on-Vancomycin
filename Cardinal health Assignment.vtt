Dr. Patel is reviewing the case of a patient who received Vancomycin, but still

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:08.572
the condition of the patient has not improved. What went wrong? Click

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.442
each icon to view the objective of our course.

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:28.724
select  'Understand Why Vancomycin Fails' in order to proceed.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.997
Vancomycin absorption level depends on ways or routes of its administration.

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:39.434
Click each card to reveal more details on Vancomycin administration routes

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:43.912
and absorption level. Some details will also be narrated for clarity.

00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:48.079
Vancomycin is administered through various routes, each with different absorption

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.172
levels. In this interactivity, you will analyse different patient

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:56.527
scenarios while exploring special cases. Click on each icon

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:58.674
to reveal the respective case study.

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:03.267
The Vancomycin administration route depends on absorption level of vancomycin

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:07.359
in each route. Drag and rank the administration routes from most to

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.889
least. Remember that special cases exist, but focus on overall

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.977
effectiveness.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.330
Test your understanding of Vancomycin absorption. Click on each tab

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.143
